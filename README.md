# Rebar Deps Graph

Generate a dependency graph with [Rebar](https://github.com/rebar/rebar).

## Install

In your `rebar.config`, add the following lines :

```
{deps, [{rebar_deps_graph, ".*",
         {git, "git://github.com/emedia-project/rebar_deps_graph"}}]}.

{plugins, [deps_graph_plugin] }.
```

That's all ;)

> This plugin has been tested with `rebar` 2.3.0.

## Usage

While the plugin is _installed_, you can use the command :

```
rebar graph-deps [graph=<file>]
```

Attribute `graph` allow you to specify an output file. If not present, the result will be send on the standard output.

The output is a [Graphviz](http://graphviz.org/) file.

> Before using `graph-deps` get the dependencies using `get-deps`.

## Example

The following image show the dependency graph of the [emedia](https://github.com/emedia-project/emedia) project.

An edge between a named node and a point indicate that the plugin was unable to retrieve the dependency for the given node. In this example, the dependencies for `file monitor`, `cowling` and `ranch` are unknown.

[Here](riak-deps.png) is another example for the [Riak](https://github.com/basho/riak) project.
